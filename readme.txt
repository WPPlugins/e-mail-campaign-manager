This plugin allows You to manage any e-mail subscription list with ease. Unlimited users. Unlimited campaigns. Forever FREE.

== Description ==

The plugin allows You to manage Your customers subscription list. You can create **unlimited campaigns**, which can store **unlimited e-mail subscriptions**. Doesn't it sound great? Plus, You can import/export Your e-mails at **any time**.
It works both for newsletter subscriptions or letting users to download Your file (like PDF e-books, etc.) once user confirms the new subscription.

= Setup in seconds =
* Create new campaign with minimum effort
* Generate the subscription form (it can be either *short_code* or standard *HTML* code)
* Modify the form (if You're a programmer), or leave it as it is - both ways are great
* Place the form on the site (anywhere in the theme or on any page/post)
* And that's it. **YOU'RE DONE!** Now let the magic happen.

= New subscriptions =
* Once Your customer submits the form - the confirmation e-mail will be sent. The e-mail contains Your custom message and the activation link.
* The activation link is created automatically, and after clicking the link - there's a redirect to the *Thank You* page or to any specified path, eg. to a file download, if You want to share Your e-books, music or anything else.
* The form contains a spam protection called *honeypot* and the *security hash* to prevent sending the form by the robots over and over.

= Import / Export =
Anytime You can easily export subscribers from any category. Just select category and a list of activated users will be generated. All e-mail addresses comma-separated - ready do copy and paste to Your e-mail sending software.

The same with the import. If You have a list of comma-separated e-mail addresses - just paste them into textarea field, then select campaign You want them to join. Click on Import button. And You're done! Everything's now in database.

= Other features =
One e-mail address can join particular campaign only once. Our app keeps the subscription list clean to avoid duplicating users, so You don't have to worry about that.
There's a button in Dashboard area to clean up the list of e-mails that have not been confirmed for more than 30 days.
Now You can generate link to user unsubscription.

= Feature Roadmap =
We're going to create a feature that allows You to migrate Your whole e-mails and campaigns database with ease. It can be helpful if You want to copy all the goodness You've collected to another project.
Plus, we're open to any suggestions. You can drop us a line at the official plugin page: [E-mail Campaign Manager](http://learntofrontend.com/plugins/e-mail-campaign-manager "E-mail Campaign Manager plugin site")
